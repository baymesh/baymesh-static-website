Meshtastic is an open-source project that allows people to communicate over long distances without relying on traditional cellular networks or Wi-Fi. It uses affordable devices equipped with LoRa (Long Range) technology to create a mesh network, enabling text messaging and GPS location sharing even in remote areas. Ideal for outdoor adventures, emergency situations, and local events, Meshtastic provides a simple and reliable way to stay connected when other communication methods are unavailable.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Net</title><link>https://bayme.sh/docs/weekly-net/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bayme.sh/docs/weekly-net/</guid><description>Wednesday at 5pm.

Meshtastic Net I will keep it open from 5-6pm for checkins so you do not have to rush. The message format will just be (LONG NAME) - (CITY YOU ARE IN) #BayMeshNet. So for example I would do Ko6cnt Base - Santa Clara #BayMeshNet.
Voice Call Also at the same time at 5pm we will be holding a voice call in the discord voice channel.</description></item><item><title>Emergency/Private Use</title><link>https://bayme.sh/docs/emergency-private-use/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bayme.sh/docs/emergency-private-use/</guid><description>If you are planning on using Meshtastic in the Bay Area and don&amp;rsquo;t want to participate in the broader network, or what to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re setup with your friends/family in case of an emergency, that&amp;rsquo;s cool.
