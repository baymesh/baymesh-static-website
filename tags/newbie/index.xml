SeeedStudio Tracker T1000-E The T1000-E by SeeedStudio is one of the few “ready to go” out of the box nodes available with a ~2 day battery life and integrated GPS. It is IP65 and approximately the size of a credit card (but thicker). These features and its low cost make it an excellent starter unit for first time Meshtastic users.
Pros Long battery life (2+ days) GPS &amp;amp; Battery Included ~$40 USD IP65 case Cons No support for external antenna Rak Wisblock The WisBlock is the “Lego” of Meshtastic nodes.</description></item><item><title>Recommended Settings</title><link>https://bayme.sh/docs/getting-started/recommended-settings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bayme.sh/docs/getting-started/recommended-settings/</guid><description>Please make sure to update the firmware on your device as you get started. The easiest way to do that is to use the Web Flasher. The latest stable release, even if labeled Beta, is generally a very safe option.
Most importantly make sure to keep all automatic beacons like telemetry and position (if used on a stationary node) to 6 hour +. If you want to send position while moving, use Smart Position, with minimum 10 minutes and distance trigger 100 to 130.</description></item></channel></rss>
