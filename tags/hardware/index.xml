SeeedStudio Tracker T1000-E The T1000-E by SeeedStudio is one of the few “ready to go” out of the box nodes available with a ~2 day battery life and integrated GPS. It is IP65 and approximately the size of a credit card (but thicker). These features and its low cost make it an excellent starter unit for first time Meshtastic users.
Pros Long battery life (2+ days) GPS &amp;amp; Battery Included ~$40 USD IP65 case Cons No support for external antenna Rak Wisblock The WisBlock is the “Lego” of Meshtastic nodes.</description></item></channel></rss>
