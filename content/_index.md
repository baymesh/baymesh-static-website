## What is [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/)?

Meshtastic is an open-source, decentralized, off-grid mesh network. It's made up of small communicators that can form a mesh network. These communicators can be linked to a phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Meshtastic uses inexpensive LoRa radios as a long-range communication platform.  Learn more at the official Meshtastic website.
