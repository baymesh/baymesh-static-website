Introduction to Meshtastic Meshtastic is an open-source project that enables long-range, low-power, mesh communication using inexpensive hardware. It is primarily designed for outdoor activities, emergency scenarios, and other use cases where traditional communication infrastructure is unavailable.
Core Components Hardware
LoRa Modules: Meshtastic uses LoRa (Long Range) modules, which are capable of transmitting data over several kilometers using minimal power.</description></item><item><title>MQTT</title><link>https://bayme.sh/docs/getting-started/mqtt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bayme.sh/docs/getting-started/mqtt/</guid><description>This is on the most advanced side of things. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what &amp;ldquo;MQTT&amp;rdquo; is, leave it disabled. You do not need to turn MQTT to have your messages on the logger.
This is also only useful on &amp;ldquo;base station&amp;rdquo; nodes. Ones that are in a good position to pick up messages AND with a stable internet/wifi connection.
MQTT is the technology used to feed the mesh data to the internet (aka what powers the Mesh Maps, Discord Logger, etc).</description></item><item><title>Recommended Hardware</title><link>https://bayme.sh/docs/getting-started/recommended-hardware/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bayme.sh/docs/getting-started/recommended-hardware/</guid><description>See also Discord #resources thread
SeeedStudio Tracker T1000-E The T1000-E by SeeedStudio is one of the few “ready to go” out of the box nodes available with a ~2 day battery life and integrated GPS. It is IP65 and approximately the size of a credit card (but thicker). These features and its low cost make it an excellent starter unit for first time Meshtastic users.
Pros Long battery life (2+ days) GPS &amp;amp; Battery Included ~$40 USD IP65 case Cons No support for external antenna Rak Wisblock The WisBlock is the “Lego” of Meshtastic nodes.</description></item><item><title>Recommended Settings</title><link>https://bayme.sh/docs/getting-started/recommended-settings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bayme.sh/docs/getting-started/recommended-settings/</guid><description>Please make sure to update the firmware on your device as you get started. The easiest way to do that is to use the Web Flasher. The latest stable release, even if labeled Beta, is generally a very safe option.
Most importantly make sure to keep all automatic beacons like telemetry and position (if used on a stationary node) to 1 hour +.
In the Bay Area, we have a few recommendations for configuration:</description></item></channel></rss>
